        <div>India has been a federal republic since 1950, governed through a democratic parliamentary system. It is a pluralistic, multilingual and multi-ethnic society. India's population grew from 361 million in 1951 to almost 1.4 billion in 2022.[61] During this time, its nominal per capita income increased from US$64 annually to US$2,601, and its literacy rate from 16.6% to 74%. A comparatively destitute country in 1951,[62] India has become a fast-growing major economy and a hub for information technology services; it has an expanding middle class.[63] Indian movies and music increasingly influence global culture.[64] India has reduced its poverty rate, though at the cost of increasing economic inequality.[65] It is a nuclear-weapon state that ranks high in military expenditure. It has disputes over Kashmir with its neighbours, Pakistan and China, unresolved since the mid-20th century.[66] Among the socio-economic challenges India faces are gender inequality, child malnutrition,[67] and rising levels of air pollution.[68] India's land is megadiverse with four biodiversity hotspots.[69] India's wildlife, which has traditionally been viewed with tolerance in its culture,[70] is supported among these forests and elsewhere in protected habitats.</div>
